# Example for BT.601 625-line Color Space
#
# BT.601 is a standard for converting analog video into the digital domain,
# and serves as a reference for the color space of analog video, but the color
# spaces defined existed before the standard.
#
# Due to historical differences, there are two color spaces in BT.601: one for
# 525-line television (developed in the U.S.), and one for 625-line television
# (developed in Europe).  The color spaces, along with NTSC-J, converged upon
# the development of HD television with the BT.709 standard.
#
# This color space should be used for most 50 Hz arcade systems, consoles, and
# computer systems.
