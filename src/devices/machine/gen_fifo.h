/* Generic fifo device with flow control
 *
 *
 * To use it:
 * - Create the device, put push/pop in the appropriate memory maps of
 *   the source (push) and destination (pop) devices
 * - Connect the empty/full callbacks in the MCFG if needed
 * - Call setup at init with the size and the callbacks
 * - Enjoy
 *
 * The design is such that destination devices must be able to be
 * halted and to retrigger a fifo read when asked to, while the source
 * devices only need to be haltable.  There is some leeway on the
 * source devices, e.g. no values are ever lost, so one can rudely
 * overflow the fifo when the source is not a simple executable
 * device.
 *
 * The callbacks:
 * - on_fifo_empty_pre_sync:
 *     Called on a pop with an empty fifo.  Must ask the destination
 *     to try again (e.g. ->stall() or equivalent).  The pop itself
 *     will then return zero.  Triggers a machine-wide sync, because
 *     the source device may be behind and could push data in the
 *     remaining of its timeslice.
 *
 * - on_fifo_empty_post_sync:
 *     Called after the sync consecutive to a pop with an empty fifo.
 *     It means that even with the source device synced the fifo is
 *     still empty.  The destination device should be halted.
 *
 * - on_fifo_unempty:
 *     Called when the fifo is filled again after a call to
 *     on_fifo_empty_post_sync.  The destination device should be
 *     restarted, the pop will succeed this time.
 *
 * - on_fifo_full_post_sync:
 *     When the source pushes in a full fifo, the extra value is
 *     stored and a machine sync is triggered to give a chance to the
 *     destination device to pop some of the fifo data in its
 *     remaining timeslice.  If after the sync the fifo is still full,
 *     that callback is triggered.  The source device should be halted.
 *
 * - on_fifo_unfull:
 *     Called when the fifo again has free space after a call to
 *     on_fifo_full_post_sync.  The source device should be restarted.
 *
 * - on_push:
 *     Called when a new value was just pushed.  That callback is
 *     usually not needed, but it can be useful when the destination
 *     is not an executable device but something hardcoded
 *     (rasterizer, etc).
 *
 * - on_pop:
 *     Called when a new value was just popped.  That callback is
 *     usually not needed, but it can be useful when the source is not
 *     an executable device but something hardcoded.
 *
 * Note: setup can be called multiple times, each call overrides the
 * previous and clears the fifo.
 *
 * Note: the fifo element type T must be copyable if one wants to use
 * peek().  It must trivially copyable and of size 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes
 * to use the memory-map accessors.  Otherwise only movability is
 * required.
