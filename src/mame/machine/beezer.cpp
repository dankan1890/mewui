        bit 5: output?: N/C
        bit 4: output?: FMSEL1 (does not appear elsewhere on schematics! what does this do? needs tracing) - always 0?

        bit 1: output: FM or AM (appears to control some sort of suppression or filtering change of the post-DAC amplifier when enabled, only during the TIMER1 OUT time-slot of the multiplexer, see page 1B 3-3 of schematics) - always 0? why is there a special circuit for it?
        bit 0: output?: DMOD DISABLE (does not appear elsewhere on schematics! what does this do? needs tracing) - on startup is 0, turns to 1 and stays that way?
