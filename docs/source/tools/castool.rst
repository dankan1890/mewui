Castool - *A generic cassette image manipulation tool for MAME*
===============================================================



Castool is a tool for the maintenance and manipulation of cassette images that MAME users need to deal with. MAME directly supports .WAV audio formatted images, but many of the existing images out there may come in forms such as .TAP for Commodore 64 tapes, .CAS for Tandy Color Computer tapes, and so forth. Castool will convert these other formats to .WAV for use in MAME.

Castool is part of the MAME project. It shares large portions of code with MAME, and its existence would not be if it were not for MAME.  As such, the distribution terms are the same as MAME.  Please read the MAME license thoroughly.


Using Castool
=============

Castool is a command line program that contains a simple set of instructions. Commands are invoked in a manner along the lines of this:

	**castool convert <format> <inputfile> <outputfile>**

* **<format>** is the format of the image
* **<inputfile>** is the filename of the image you're converting from
* **<outputfile>** is the filename of the output WAV file

Example usage:
	castool convert coco zaxxon.cas zaxxon.wav

	castool convert cbm arkanoid.tap arkanoid.wav

	castool convert ddp mybasicprogram.ddp mybasicprogram.wav
