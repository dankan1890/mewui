Nutting Icebox

2018-08-19 Skeleton driver. It's all guesswork.

It's a case with many slots for daughter boards, and 2 floppy drives. It's an "in-circuit emulator"
for Bally / Astrocade development.

The unit has 5 daughter boards: 3 boards were photographed and are: a cpu board (Z80 and XTAL),
                    a RS232 board (2x 8251, 8 dipswitches connected to a BR1941L, 4.9152 XTAL),
                    and a board covered with TTL.

Commands:
- At the main % prompt:
-- A = Arcade
-- C = Commercial
-- D = Debug
-- ^C = boot CP/M
-- ^T = load data from disk to 0000
-- ^X = new line
- At the debug prompt: (to be done)   Q to quit

Status:
- Machine boots up, you can enter commands.
- For ^C (boot disk), it is able to read track 00 into memory. It then asks for 18x 128 bytes from track 01.
  It reads 8 of those blocks, then hangs.

To Do:
- Find out more what ports F2-FF do.

The floppy drives are a special type containing a FDC within. The FDC is a FD1771-B01 with a 4MHz XTAL.


NOTES FROM AL KOSSOW
--------------------

This is the Nutting Associates ICE box used for Bally arcade and Astrocade development.

The games are written in "Terse", a dialect of FORTH with graphics and sound extensions.

The game graphics and sound hardware were in a separate chassis connected through 50 pin ribbon cables.
There is 64K of ram that can be mapped to the addresses used where the proms in the game would be.

Development appeared to have started under CP/M, then they migrated to development in the Terse environment.
The sector size also changed from 128 to 1024 bytes. For some reason, the hardware inverts the sector data.
CP/M flipped the bits, Terse does not.

There is a 122 pin backplane, and five cards. The bus buffers for the floppies and the external hardware
are on the backplane. There is an I/O, memory mapper, dual 32k static ram, and CPU cards. The I/O card has
a three byte FIFO and a buffer for forcing 00 onto the data bus, which appears to be related to handling
breakpoints from looking at the code in ICE.ASM.

The eprom dump is for booting Terse, and earlier version of the prom is documented in ICE.ASM which may be for CP/M

The CPU card has 1K of ram, mapped to FC00. They must have moved the sector buffering to main RAM, since a
1K sector obviously wouldn't fit.

The crystal on the CPU is 9.8304MHz. It may be possible to alter the cpu speed. There is a FAST signal on the bp.

I/O registers from the ICE.ASM listing

CRTD    E0    terminal uart data
CRTS    E1    terminal uart control
LPTD    E2    printer uart data
LPTS    E3    printer uart control

DATA    E4    1771 regs
SECTOR  E5
TRACK   E6
COMMAND E7

CENABE  F0
SELECT  F1    bit 0 & 1 (select drive 0-3), bit 2 (enable floppy interrupt)
FIFO    F2    3 BYTE FIFO

EXTL    F8    These are probably for the mapping registers
EXTH    F9

WPROTL  FA
WPROTH  FB

BADRH   FC    BASE ADR? breakpoint
BADRL   FD

BTYPE   FE
MISC    FF

the 0 is forced onto the bus when bp signal IRESET/ is asserted. it appears to come from the CPU board (only
the cpu and io board are connected to it)

the box doesn't do remapping, it just has two 16 bit write-only registers that can unmap and write protect memory
in 16 4k chunks, (extl,exth), (wprotl,wproth) .

breakpoint (badrh, barl) specifies an adr to nmi on, with a 4 bit reference type in btype (wr, req, iorq, mreq)

it looks like zeroing btype disables it.

io port 0xff (misc) is on the I/O board.

The date on the backplane of the system is 1978. It originally used dynamic RAM boards for memory, there is support
on the 'mapper' board for generating row/col adrs for them, and four ram board selects. It was replaced with a static
RAM in 1982, based on the date of the boards in the system. Two selects go to each 32k board and there is a DIP switch
on the boards to say which of the four selects it responds to.

The three byte fifo and a register jams a zero onto the data bus (when?), and we have the source for the CP/M version
of the debugger/boot prom to see how interrupt handling occurs.

I can sort of piece together what Terse implements and what it evolved from. I think it started as the Caltech FORTH
implemented for the PDP-10 and 11 with a lot of words stripped out, and others added. This was submitted to DECUS as
submission 11-232 but much of the early DECUS stuff has been lost, so I've not been able to find a copy to see how the
FORTH kernel was implemented. I do have the Caltech writeup on it though,
http://bitsavers.org/pdf/caltech/ovro/Caltech-OVRO_Forth_Manual_Jun78.pdf

First, ^T to boot the boot portion of Terse from Blocks 1 through 4.
The Command "5 LOAD" will boot full Terse.
The disk label says:  220 LOAD (which also boots full Terse I think?)
and then: 158 LOAD, which loads the Gorf binary into RAM

You can also use:
250 0 DIR (for example)
to see the "first line comments" for a range of blocks.  There is some stuff related to cross-compiling there I haven't tried yet.

Note: Blocks in Terse start with 1, not 0.

The "Fasterse" content on the disk is the Source for the "binary-only" version of Terse in the commercial games.  You can see that
is exactly the same as the code in the low memory of Gorf.

Also, this disk is hand-labelled 7-Feb-81.
The Gorf binary on the disk is the same as the release, except for an embedded date code - it is 18-Feb-81 on the disk.
It is 24-Feb-81 in the commercial release gorf roms.


My Forth is extremely rusty and I happen to look at disks with problems. If you try to do 5 LOAD with the FORLANG disk it comes
up with a Read Error? message.. Argh. There could be a fault in the IMD. Not sure. Great that other disks work.

Disks like 611ROTO have a disk backup system or something, and when you boot it up with ^T it hangs. I've narrowed it down to a
BUSY wait which never exits (at $308a eventually).

I think it's a quirk of the FD1771 chip thats not emulated accurately causing this. The first track of data is read using the
READ (multiple) in a loop reading 10 consecutive sectors which occurs fine, and when it's finished reading the sectors an INTERRUPT
command is issued to stop the FD1171 feeding data. According to all the datasheets I've looked at, the BUSY flag should get set to
0 immediately once the INTERRUPT command is executed (and the mame code does this), but the code in this case calls a subroutine
which waits until the BUSY flag is ON and then waits until the flag is OFF. This works elsewhere as it's used to wait until the
SEEK command is completed.
